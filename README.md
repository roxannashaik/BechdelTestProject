Binary Classifier 
<p>Bechdal_main.ipynb contains the main 4 plots on the sample data. It contains the majority of the preliminary analysis as well as the resulting plots and graphs. In addition, scripts are crawled from IMSDb and stored as text files. ScriptCrawler.ipynb contains the code that crawls the resulting text files and stores it into Postgres. sample-models.inpynb contains the code that classifies the bechdel data with various stacked models were derived from what gridsearch determined was based on the full data. The sample_data.csv file contains a small sample of the overall data that we used. Extra files included are Numbers Webcrawler(1).inpynb, which crawls The-Numbers website and Tokens, which contains the code, that extracts tokens from the scripts and computes the frequency as well as the tf-idf. Model.inpynb is what was used to classify all the data. The everything.inpynb file contains a mishmash of data analysis, plots and trial and error. </p>
<p>CrawlersandOtherAttempt folder contains the crawlers we did not end up using for scripts as well as the model for the financial data. </p>
